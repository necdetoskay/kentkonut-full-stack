## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Components
- `app/dashboard/pages/[id]/edit/NewContentEditor.tsx` - Updated folder configuration
- `components/media/MediaBrowserSimple.tsx` - Enhanced upload flow and selection

### Testing
- `scripts/test-page-media-uploader-improvements.js` - Comprehensive test suite

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [recentlyUploadedFiles, setRecentlyUploadedFiles] = useState<GlobalMediaFile[]>([]);
```

### Upload Complete Handler
```typescript
const handleUploadComplete = (uploadedFiles: any[]) => {
  // Convert to GlobalMediaFile format
  const uploadedGlobalFiles: GlobalMediaFile[] = uploadedFiles.map(file => ({
    id: file.id,
    url: file.url,
    filename: file.filename || file.originalName,
    // ... other properties
  }));
  
  // Store for auto-selection
  setRecentlyUploadedFiles(uploadedGlobalFiles);
  
  // Refresh gallery
  setTimeout(() => forceRefresh(), 500);
};
```

### Auto-Selection Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (recentlyUploadedFiles.length > 0 && mediaFiles.length > 0) {
    // Find uploaded files in current media list
    const uploadedFilesInList = recentlyUploadedFiles
      .map(uploadedFile => 
        mediaFiles.find(mediaFile => 
          mediaFile.id === uploadedFile.id || 
          mediaFile.url === uploadedFile.url ||
          mediaFile.filename === uploadedFile.filename
        )
      )
      .filter(Boolean) as GlobalMediaFile[];
    
    // Auto-select found files
    if (uploadedFilesInList.length > 0) {
      setSelectedFiles(uploadedFilesInList);
      setRecentlyUploadedFiles([]);
    }
  }
}, [mediaFiles, recentlyUploadedFiles]);
```

### Visual Feedback
```typescript
const isRecentlyUploaded = recentlyUploadedFiles.some(f => 
  f.id === file.id || f.url === file.url || f.filename === file.filename
);

// NEW badge
{isRecentlyUploaded && (
  <div className="absolute top-2 right-2 z-10">
    <div className="bg-green-500 text-white text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded-full font-medium shadow-sm">
      YENİ
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created to verify all improvements:

```bash
node scripts/test-page-media-uploader-improvements.js
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Default folder configuration (/media/sayfa)

2. ✅ After upload, users stay in gallery with uploaded files pre-selected
