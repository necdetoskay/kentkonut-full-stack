## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before Consolidation
- 😕 **Confusing**: Two separate systems for staff management
- 😕 **Inconsistent**: Different workflows for new vs edit department
- 😕 **Data Loss**: Supervisor data stored in mock database
- 😕 **Maintenance**: Duplicate code and functionality

### After Consolidation
- 😊 **Simple**: Single personnel system for all staff
- 😊 **Consistent**: Same workflow for new and edit department
- 😊 **Persistent**: All data stored in real database
- 😊 **Maintainable**: Clean, unified codebase

## 📋 Current Workflow

### Creating New Department
1. User goes to `/dashboard/kurumsal/birimler/new`
2. Fills out department form and saves
3. Success page shows with "Personel Ekle" button

### Editing Existing Department
1. User goes to department edit page
